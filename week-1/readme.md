# ðŸ§­ Guide to Week 1 exercises

This README will guide you through the different sections for this week.

## Exercises

In this section, you'll have a short program and task. Some of the syntax may be unfamiliar - however, if there's anything unfamiliar you can look up the syntax in documentation online.

## Errors

In this section, you'll need to go to each file in `errors` directory and run the file with node to check what the error is. Your task is to interpret the error message and explain why it occurs. The [errors documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors) will help you figure out the solution.

You must use documentation to make sense of anything unfamiliar - this is part of being a developer!
You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.
