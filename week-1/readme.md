# ðŸ§­ Guide to Week 1 exercises

This README will guide you through the different sections for this week.

## Exercises

In this section, you'll have a short program with and a short task to complete. Some of the syntax may be unfamiliar - however, if there's anything unfamiliar you can look up the functions or syntax in the documentation.

## Errors

In this section, you'll need to go to each file in `errors` directory and run the file with node to check what the error is.

## Interpret

In these tasks, you'll be given a slightly larger program with some syntax / operators / functions that will be unfamiliar.
You'll need to read each of the programs and use documentation to make sense of anything that is unfamiliar - this is part of being a developer!. You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.
This will help you to build up your intuition of what the programs are doing.
