// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?

// b) How many function calls are there?

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression totalSeconds % 60 represents

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?

// 3) Will this code work when the movieLength for all values?
