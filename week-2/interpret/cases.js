// A set of words can be grouped together in different cases.

// For example, "hello there" in snake case would be written "hello_there"

// UPPER_SNAKE_CASE means taking a string and writing it in

// Implement a function that takes a string "hello there" and returns the string in UPPER_CAMEL_CASE, so "HELLO_THERE"
// Another example: "lord of the rings" should be "LORD_OF_THE_RINGS"

// Use the string documentation to help you find a solution
