// The expression Math.sqrt(a ** 2 + b ** 2) is the famous formula for calculating the longest length in a right angled triangle: Pythagoras' theorem
// Implement a function calculateHypotenuse that take takes 2 sides of a triangle and calculates the length of the longest side
// Call your function with different arguments to check it is working
