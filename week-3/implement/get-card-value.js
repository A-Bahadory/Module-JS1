// You will need to implement a function getCardValue
// You need to write assertions for your function to check it works in different cases

// Given a card string in the format "A♠" (representing a card in blackjack),
// When the function getCardValue is called with this card string as input,
// Then it should return the numerical card value

// Given the input card string, such as "A♠",
// When the function extracts the rank (in this case, "A"),
// Then it should proceed to determine the card value based on this rank.

// Handle Number Cards (2-10):
// Given a card with a rank between "2" and "9",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the numeric value corresponding to the rank (e.g., "5" should return 5).

// Handle Face Cards (J, Q, K):
// Given a card with a rank of "10," "J," "Q," or "K",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the value 10, as these cards are worth 10 points each in blackjack.

// Handle Ace (A):
// Given a card with a rank of "A",
// When the function is called with an Ace,
// Then it should, by default, assume the Ace is worth 11 points, which is a common rule in blackjack.

// Handle Invalid Cards:
// Given a card with an invalid rank (neither a number nor a recognized face card),
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should throw an error indicating "Invalid card rank."
// This specification outlines the behavior of the getCardValue function for different input scenarios, including valid and invalid card ranks, and defines the expected output or action for each case.
